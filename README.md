## Repository Policy

This repository will be rebased on top of the main repository for updates.
Each change is kept into small individual commits for this reason, because it means that conflicts with commits are small and easy to easy to handle.

All changes to the index are done via the `update index` commit, which will be amended and moved to the end with each rebase, as it is a commit that functionally doesn't matter.
